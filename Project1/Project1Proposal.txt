Project Name: Noughts and Crosses (aka Tic-Tac-Toe)

User can play games of Noughts and Crosses (Tic-Tac-Toe) against the system.
They can choose to start a new game, or to continue a game that they were
previously playing. The users can view a record of all their own played 
games, showing wins, losses etc. They can also view an overall score board,
showing a number of most recent wins from the pool of all users.

1. Allow user to login (account creation etc)

2. User can choose to:
    * start a new game
    * continue playing a game that was previously "saved"
    * view their own wins and losses (with dates/times?)
    * clear their own win/loss history
    * view an overall score board showing numbers of wins/losses for all users.

3. Allow user to play the game:
    * user plays against the system. 
    * by entering digits corresponding to game board positions.
    * minimal implementation of rules, just enough to get it working reasonably.
    * at any point during the game, the user can choose to "save" the current state
      for possible continuation at a later time.

4. Nice to Have (depending on progress):
    * add user passwords (stored as hash strings, SHA or similar, rather than plain text).
    * when users "save" the current state, perhaps allow them to give it a name, and
      allow multiple different game runs to be "saved".
    * allow users to choose the board layout numbering 
      (eg by telephone digit layout, or numeric keypad layout).
